This project is the PyTorch implementation of our AAAI23 paper: Fast and Accurate Binary Neural Networks based on Depth-Width Reshaping. 

Using the algorithms described in the paper to reproduce: naive reshaping, pre-training, pruning(pruning code in the 'Pruning' folder) to get the result models for training£»
Or training directly using the result models(code in the 'CIFAR-10' and 'ImageNet' folders).

**Dependencies**

- Python 3.7.4
- Pytorch == 1.3.0
- sklearn 0.22.1
